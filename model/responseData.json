  "multiples": "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print \"Fizz\" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print \"Buzz\". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \"FizzBuzz\".",
  "palindrome": "Write a program that detects palindrome number. The program receives a number between 1000 and 9999, then it should display if the given number is a palindrome number or not. Note: a palidrome number is a number that its value is the same read it from right to left and left to right.",
  "fibonacci": "Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 5 terms will be:1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... Write a program that finds the sum of the even-valued terms, by considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed one hundred.",
  "hexadecimal": "Write a program that translates a decimal integer into hexadecimal.",
  "permuation": "Write a program to display all possible permutations of a given input string if the string contains duplicate characters, you may have multiple repeated results. For Ex :1) if user input string \"cat\" then it should print output like cat,cta,act,atc,tac,tca. 2) if user input string \"ball\" then it should print output like ball,ball,blal,blla,blla,blal,abll,abll,albl,allb,allb,albl,labl,lalb,lbal,lbla,llba,llab,lalb,labl,llab,llba,lbla,lbal."
